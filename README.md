<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<p>The project provides a simplistic and easy to navigate webpage that doesnt strain or overwhlem the eye.
The purpose of the website is clear and the user has the option to search for specific areas of the webpage if 
they dont want to read every paragraph.</p>

<h2>UX Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>I focused on creating the header, how I wanted the website title to look and
where I wanted the menu items to be.</li>
<li>I then added the footer, following the basic layout covered in the website creation in
css fundamentals.</li>
<li>Once I had established the head and footer layout, I then began to add the title and menu names
and the code necessary to view it on both desktops and mobile devices. I want to keep the colour theme very 
light and classic.</li>
<li> I added some icons from font awesome to include with my title, added hover affects to the menu items
and added the social media icons to the header.</li>
<li> I then added the main image that I wanted to stand out at the top of the page beneath the title and menu
items. This was followed by the middle text section, which again was originally done very basic following the
guideance in css fundamentals. Once I had established how I wanted to present the middle section, I included bootstrap
code  in order for it to display appropriately on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
<li>Once i had everything in the home page laid out, i duplicated this for the second and third webpages.</li>
<li>I did have a carousel included but found this to look better on mobile devices than desktop so decided on not including it.</li>
<li>I originally had all of the text center aligned but decided this didn't look right so set it to default left aligned.</li>
<li>I then added another section which would contain a heading and short paragraph beneath the main picture and added a background colour
in order for it to stand out from the below headings and paragraphs.</li>
<li>I added a margin and padding to the second section and a margin to the div's within the container in order to create space.</li>
<li>I added a background color to the middle section of the home page in order to make the heading and text standout. Once I was happy with that I applied this
to the dog care and contact pages.</li> 
<li>I then completed changed the nav bar system to be responsive and change to a "hamburger" menu when minimised or on a mobile device.</li>
<li>I then matched the color scheme of the nav bar to that of the middle section background colour and changed the search button colour
to also match the over all colour scheme of the page.</li>
<li>Once I was happy with the final page, I git add . everything, git comit and then git push to git pages.</li></ol>

<h2>Design</h2>
<li>Colour scheme is that of grey and white.</li>
<li>Two fonts are used throughout. These include dancing script for the heading and domine for the body.</li>
<li>There are 3 main images used in order to grab the users attention and just make the page appealing and nice to look at.</li>

<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Main image - this zooms inwards which I thought would be a nice affect to catch the users eye, mainly on the beauty of the cocker spaniel.</li> 
<li>Menu hover - allows user to see their mouse pointer is over specific menu sections.</li>
<li>Responsive on all devices.</li>
<li>Search button.</li>
<li>"Hamburger" menu when minimising/on a mobile device.</li>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>

<h3>Programs</h3>
<li>Bootstrap 4 - used to assist in responsiveness and styling of the project webpage.</li>
<li>Font Awesome - used to add the icons to the webpage title.</li>
<li>Google fonts - used to import the code needed for the fonts used within the project.</li>
<li>jQuery - comes with bootstrap and is needed for certain elements to run, such as the navbar.</li>
<li>Git / Gitpod - used to type the code, add and commit to git and then push to git hub.</li>
<li>Github - used to store projects code.</li>
<li>Key frames - used to create the zoom in affect on the main images.</li>


<h2>Testing</h2>
<li>W3C CSS Validator - no errors found within the css.</li>
<li>W3C Markup Validator - only flagged the main image outer as not having a h2 but this isnt needed.</li>
<li>Website was tested on Google chrome, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Page was inspected in order to view on various devices and ensure hamburger menu was working.</li>
<li>Friends were asked to view the page to ensure it worked.</li>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>In my original navbar layout, which was seperated via a justify-content-between container to add spacing between the title and the menu items, had an issue where on mobile devices the hover affect would overlap with the text beneath. 
This was fixed when i changed the navbar completely to a responsive one within bootstrap.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>The project was deployed to Github pages following the below steps:
<li>Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository</li>
<li>At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu. </li>
<li>Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.</li>
<li>Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".</li>
<li>The page will automatically refresh.</li>
<li>Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.</li>
</p>
