                    <p> English Cocker Spaniels are considered a great dog for first time owners due to their sweet, affectionate and cuddly temperament. 
                        They are a cheerful breed who constantly has a wagging tail and aims to please their owner.</p> 
                    <p>They are suited to those with a large apartment or home and accompanying yard. On top of this, they are highly intelligent, making them easy to train 
                        and very adaptable to their new family's lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>The English Cocker Spaniel is medium-sized with long ears and a happy attitude to life. They are classed as a gun dog and were 
                    used for hunting variest types of birds. There are, however, two types of cocker, the working type and the show
                    type.</p>
                    <p>The working type is that, used as a working dog and are very energetic much like the Springer Spaniel, they will run and run
                    and when you get home will still want to run. The show cocker, will run and run but when returning home will happily retreat to their 
                    bed in the company of their owner.</p>
