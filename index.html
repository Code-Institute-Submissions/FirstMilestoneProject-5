                <p>The English Cocker Spaniel is one of the oldest spaniel breeds and can be traced back to 14th century spain. They were used to flush out small birds called woodcocks, hence the name Cockerspaniel.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Temperament</h3>
                    <p> English Cocker Spaniels are considered a great dog for first time owners due to their sweet, affectionate and cuddly temperament. 
                        They are a cheerful breed who constantly has a wagging tail and aims to please their owner.</p>
                    <p>They are suited to those with a large apartment or home and accompanying yard. On top of this, they are highly intelligent, making them easy to train 
                        and very adaptable to their new family's lifestyle.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Highlights</h3>
                    <p>Due to the fact Cocker Spaniels are so popular, it is important that the correct breeder is selected, preferable one that is dedicated to impriving the breed and ironing out any health problems from
                    from previous litters. Cocker Spaniels can be a nervous breed, even from a good breeder, and exhibit submissive urination or peeing when over excited. Train your dog from a very early age, especially
                    as Cocker's are very vocal dogs, but be sure to use gentle and consistent training methods to get the best result.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Breed</h3>
                    <p>The English Cocker Spaniel is medium-sized with long ears and a happy attitude to life. They are classed as a gun dog and were 
                    used for hunting variest types of birds. There are, however, two types of cocker, the working type and the show
                    type.</p>
                    <p>The working type is that, used as a working dog and are very energetic much like the Springer Spaniel, they will run and run
                    and when you get home will still want to run. The show cocker, will run and run but when returning home will happily retreat to their 
                    bed in the company of their owner.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4">Colours and markings</h3>
                    <p> There are many variations of coat colour for this breed, including black, liver with brown, red with black, red with brown, golden, golden with black, golden with brown, brown and white, black and white and the lemon and white.</p>
